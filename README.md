## 🌟 Overview

**GenericAgent** is a minimal, self-evolving autonomous agent framework. Its core is just **~3K lines of code**. Through **9 atomic tools + a ~100-line Agent Loop**, it grants any LLM system-level control over a local computer — covering browser, terminal, filesystem, keyboard/mouse input, screen vision, and mobile devices (ADB).

Its design philosophy: **don't preload skills — evolve them.**

Every time GenericAgent solves a new task, it automatically crystallizes the execution path into an skill for direct reuse later. The longer you use it, the more skills accumulate — forming a skill tree that belongs entirely to you, grown from 3K lines of seed code.

> **🤖 Self-Bootstrap Proof** — Everything in this repository, from installing Git and running `git init` to every commit message, was completed autonomously by GenericAgent. The author never opened a terminal once.

> **📝 Personal Note** — I'm using this fork primarily to experiment with Gemini model integration and to track how the skill tree evolves over time on my own tasks. Will update this README with my findings.

## 📋 Core Features
- **Self-Evolving**: Automatically crystallizes each task into an skill. Capabilities grow with every use, forming your personal skill tree.
- **Minimal Architecture**: ~3K lines of core code. Agent Loop is ~100 lines. No complex dependencies, zero deployment overhead.
- **Strong Execution**: Injects into a real browser (preserving login sessions). 9 atomic tools take direct control of the system.
- **High Compatibility**: Supports Claude / Gemini / Kimi / MiniMax and other major models. Cross-platform.
- **Token Efficient**: <30K context window — a fraction of the 200K–1M other agents consume. Layered memory ensures the right knowledge is always in scope. Less noise, fewer hallucinations, higher success rate — at a fraction of the cost.


## 🧬 Self-Evolution Mechanism

This is what fundamentally distinguishes GenericAgent from every other agent framework.

```
[New Task] --> [Autonomous Exploration] (install deps, write scripts, debug & verify) -->
[Crystallize Execution Path into skill] --> [Write to Memory Layer] --> [Direct Recall on Next Similar Task]
```

| What you say | What the agent does the first time | Every time after |
